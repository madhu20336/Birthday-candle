# About question 
In this I  had made one function named birthdayCakeCandles.
Then i took a user input for the elements i want in an array.
Then I have made another function max  to find the maximum number from that array.

Then I applied loop to find the count of the maximum number.
- The maximum number will be compared with all the elements in the given array.
- If it finds a value with same length the the count is incremented.
- At the end the count is returned.
